                <p>Controversial plans to develop the world's first commercial octopus farm have prompted concern from campaigners 
                    and scientists over the welfare of the highly intelligent creature.</p>

                <h3>Study Reveals How Octopus Deal With Frigid Antarctic Conditions</h3>
                <p>Living in Antarctic waters that hover above freezing is challenging for any creature. A new study by researchers 
                    at the Marine Biological Laboratory has revealed how octopuses have learned to adapt and can cope with these 
                    extreme environmental conditions.</p>

                <h3>Woman Survives Bite From Blue-Ringed Octopus, One of the Most Venomous Creatures on Earth</h3>
                <p>On March 16, a woman was hanging around at Chinamans Beach in Mosman, New South Wales. While she was swimming she 
                    found a pretty little shell, like many of us have, and picked it up to appreciate it. As she was rolling it 
                    around in her hand, a tiny little creature fell out, landed on her stomach and, in the blink of an eye, bit her 
                    twice. </p>
